## iTalkSmart

“iTalkSmart” is a full-stack web application, which gives the user an opportunity to improve their public speaking skills and their ability to effectively answer interview questions. There is no registration needed to use this application. When the user initiates play a randomizer will grab a question from the database and display it. Upon which, a timer will appear. This timer will change to green when it reaches 60 seconds, yellow when it reaches 90 seconds, and red when it reaches 120 seconds, as 1-2 minutes is the ideal response time.  
There is an administrative sign area that when authenticated opens input fields, which the owner of the application can add appropriate questions to the database.
